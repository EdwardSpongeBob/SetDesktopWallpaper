# Suitable For

Users who have a large number (10,000+) of image files under a single folder and its subfolders.

# What This Program Does

1. Asks the user for a root folder.
2. Gathers all files from the root folder and its subfolders recursively.
3. Finds the right image from the list of files.
4. Sets this image as a desktop wallpaper in Windows.

# Special Features

1. If the program finds the right image, the image will always fit the user's display device (e.g. monitor).
2. If the image is set as a desktop wallpaper successfully, the program will remember the path of the root folder selected by user.

# Note

This program derives from a similar project in GitHub about setting an image as desktop background.
